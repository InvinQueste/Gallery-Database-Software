## Setup:

To run the project:
1. Install XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Navigate to the htdocs folder. Download the Gallery-Database-Software repository and place the folder there (with the same name).
3. Start MySQL and Apache on XAMPP.
4. Use localhost/phpmyadmin/ on the browser to run the SQL commands in databaseinit.sql
5. While Apache and MySQL are on, navigate to localhost/Gallery-Database-Software/ and the functional project will run there.

## Notes:

1. Use 'admin' and 'adminpass' as the credentials to login as the admin. This is hard-coded at the moment.
